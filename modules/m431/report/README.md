Today, the 21st of February 2023, has been a very productive day for our group project. We have all come to a mutual consensus as to what our project should be and have written an assignment brief. The project that our group has decided to embark on is a 3D-Game made with Unreal Engine 5. In order to accomplish this ambitious project, it was decided that I would take on the role of organization and coding, Yven would be responsible for documentation and coding, and Valentin would be responsible for documentation and coding. The first step to our project was creating a template for the game. We all worked together in order to create the necessary framework for the game. Once the template was created, we then proceeded to create a working environment for the game. This involved us setting up the proper environment for the game to run, and also making sure any necessary coding was done in order to make the game run properly. Once the template and environment were set up, we then proceeded to expand the template for our game. This involved us adding features to the game, such as characters, levels, and in-game items. In order to make the game interactive, we then proceeded to expand the environment to an interactive one. This involved us setting up the proper coding for the game to properly interact with the user. Overall, today was a very productive day for our group project. We have come to a mutual consensus as to what our project should be, written an assignment brief, and have begun the process of creating the template for the game. We are looking forward to the next steps of our project and are confident that, with the right amount of hard work and dedication, we will be able to accomplish this ambitious project.

Today I began work on the group project, a 3D game coded in Unreal Engine 5. I started by writing code, the documentation and the main story line.
I first worked on the code, taking into account the existing project structure. I incorporated the existing structure into the new code, adding new features and revising existing ones. The code was written in C++, and I took care to ensure that the code was both efficient and well-structured. Afterwards, I worked on the documentation for the project. I wrote a detailed overview of the project, which covered the functionality, the features, and the objectives. Finally, I wrote the main story line for the game. I wrote a synopsis of the game’s plot, as well as the characters and locations. I also wrote a script for the game’s dialogue and cutscenes. Overall, I spent the day working on the project and making good progress. The code is almost finished, and the documentation and story line have been written. I will continue working on the project tomorrow, with the aim of completing it within the next few days.

I will upload all my additional files next week.
