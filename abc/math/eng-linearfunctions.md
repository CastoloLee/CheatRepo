## formula - linear function

$
y = m * x + q
$

## formula - dissolving m

$
m = (y - q) : x
$

## formula - dissolving x

$
x = (y - q) / m

## calculating intercept

For simplicites sake I will refer to linear functions as `lf`.

To calculate the intercept point of two `lfs` we need to set the two functions as equal. like this:

$
f(x) = g(x)
$
$
2x = x + 1
$
<font size="1px">note that 2x belongs to f(x) and x + 1 belongs to g(x)</font>

<font size="2px">Now we have to dissolve the x for both. This can be done like this:</font>

$
2x = x + 1
$
<font size="2px">We will now subtract x from this equation. This will give us following result:</font>

$
x = 1
$

<font size="2px"> Now we have the x-position for the two. To find out the y-position of the two we will have to insert the x-value into one of the functions. This will look like this:</font>

$
f(1) = 2 * 1 = 2
$
$
y = 2
$

<font size="2px"> This is the final result</font>

$
y/x = 1/2
$

<font size="2px">important note if a linear function has the same slope it has no intercept, if they have different slopes they will have an intercept.</font>
