# CheatRepo

This is a repository for "cheating". Giving you an advantage over other while still learning is my goal. After all why not boost your educational process by the 10 folds with this repository. In this repository I will upload all my files I've used and I'll also link some projects that I'm currently working on.

## purpose

I have created this repository so that I can share my experience and knowledge and to create a efficient and easy to use source of information. 

## contact me
